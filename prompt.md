We have a serious work to do but I will like you to come up with a plan.
This current app is an ongoing project which needs to be completed as soon as possible. There are 4 types of users in the app which are admin, landlord, tenant and manager. Now the current focus is on the all other users except for the admin. From the design, the landlord and tenant screens has been created while that of the manager hasn't. For the landlord and tenant, the integration is ongoing but not yet completed.
Now this is what we need to get done: 
- Get the manager screens done
- Get the integration done for each of the user categories.

I want an implementation plan and a order of how the whole thing should be done. The design and the backend API are already done

Let me know if you have any clarification questions.
